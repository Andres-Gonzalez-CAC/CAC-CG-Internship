        <h2>This application allows you to visually see different development opportunity
        parcels.</h2><br />
        <h3>Filters</h3> <br />
        1. The Economic Development Opportunities filter allows you to search 
        for parcels based on Acreage within a range, New Market Tax Credit(NMTC),
        Foreign Trade Zone(FTZ), and Opportunity Zone(OZ).<br />

        2. The Zoning filter allows you to select a Zoning type to display when the 
        zoning layer is displayed.<br />

        3. The APN filter allows you to search for specific parcels by parcel number (APN).
    </p>
    <p>
        <h3>Layer Display</h3><br />
        You can display or turn off layers using the layer display widget
        located to the right in the map area. It looks like three stacked squares. 
    </p>
    <p>
        <h3>Select Tool</h3><br />
        The select tool is located in the top left of the map area. The dropdown arrow
        allows you to select the method of selection. the 'Completely Contained'
        will only select parcels that are fully contained by the selection shape. 
        The 'Partially Contained' option will select parcels that are outside the selection 
        shape but are intersected by the selection shape. The button directly adjacent
        to the selection drop down arrow will clear your selection.
    </p>
    <p>
        <h3>Results Page</h3><br />
        Clicking the button at the bottom will take you to the results page. Here 
        there are several buttons that add some functionality, these are located
        just above the table to the right. The first button switches between all parcels
        and the selected parcels. You are also able to 'cherry pick' parcels by clicking on them
        to highlight them. The second button will clear your selection. The third button refreshes
        the table and the fourth button allows you to export all of the parcels or just the parcels you 
        have selected. The export button allows you to choose what type of file to export. We recommend
        csv as it is able to be opened in Excel.
